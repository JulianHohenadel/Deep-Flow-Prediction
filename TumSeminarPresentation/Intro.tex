Why use deep learning for RANS systems:

\begin{PraesentationAufzaehlung}
    \item Similar highly nonlinear behaviour
    \item PDE systems are complex and hard to calculate
    \item RANS averages over the time component \newline $\implies$ 1 frame as output
    \item Training data generatable
    \item CNN's yield good image feature extraction
    \item Success in computer vision
    \item Success in physics simulation
